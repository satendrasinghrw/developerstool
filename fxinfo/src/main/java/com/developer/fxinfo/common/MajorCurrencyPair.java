	EUR_USD, /*
			 * The Euro/Dollar Pair: Perhaps the most popular currency pair is
			 * the EUR/USD, also called the �Euro.� Since the inception of the
			 * European Central Bank in 1999, the euro has the first precedence
			 * as a base currency, according to stipulated norms. The pair is
			 * impacted by economic releases both by the US Federal Reserve and
			 * the ECB. A strong dollar leads to a decline in the value of the
			 * pair and vice versa.
			 */
	USD_JPY, /*
			 * The Dollar/Japanese Yen: Traders often refer to this pair as the
			 * �Gopher.� Japan is one of the biggest net exporters in the world,
			 * which is why traders or investors regularly need to convert local
			 * currencies into the yen. The yen is also a popular currency for
			 * �carry trade� strategies. Carry trade is a strategy similar to
			 * the �buy low, sell high� plan. Due to a consistent lower interest
			 * rate on this pair, traders can profit from the interest rate
			 * differential with USD, amidst a stable exchange rate.
			 */
	GBP_USD, /*
			 * The British Pound Sterling/US Dollar: Trading this pair is often
			 * referred to as trading the �Cable.� Back in the 1800s, the
			 * exchange rate between these two currencies was transmitted via a
			 * large cable that ran along the floor of the Atlantic Ocean. In
			 * the ongoing Brexit negotiations, experts around the world are
			 * keeping a close watch on the performance of this pair.
			 */
	USD_CHF, /*
			 * The US Dollar/Swiss Franc: Popularly known as the �Swissie,� the
			 * pair is highly impacted by the interest rate differential between
			 * the US Federal Reserve and the Swiss National Bank. The Swiss
			 * franc is considered a safe haven currency, which means that in
			 * times of extreme volatility and uncertain global market
			 * conditions, the CHF appreciates in relation to the USD.
			 */
	AUD_USD, /*
			 * The Australian Dollar/US Dollar: The �Aussie,� as this pair is
			 * called, is a popular commodity pair. The Australian economy
			 * thrives on commodities trading, being a huge exporter of coal and
			 * iron-ore. The price of the AUD is therefore highly dependent on
			 * commodity prices. The pair shares a negative correlation with
			 * other pairs, such as the USD/JPY and USD/CHF.
			 */
	USD_CAD, /*
			 * The US Dollar/Canadian Dollar: Another popular commodity pair is
			 * the �Loonie.� Canada is also an economy dependent on commodity
			 * prices. It has huge reserves of timber, natural gas, and oil. Its
			 * physical proximity to the United States is an advantage, with
			 * which it shares huge trade volumes. In the ongoing trade tariffs
			 * imposed on Canada by US President Trump and retaliatory tariffs
			 * imposed by the Canadian government, the CAD has become vulnerable
			 * to market volatility.
			 */
	NZD_USD /*
			 * The New Zealand Dollar/US Dollar: Named after the popular fruit
			 * indigenous to New Zealand, the �Kiwi� is hugely impacted by the
			 * dairy market and tourism industry. New Zealand is the largest
			 * exporter of milk products, which means that if milk prices are on
			 * the rise, the NZD tends to appreciate. New Zealand�s economy also
			 * thrives on its tourism numbers.
